        In my 6+ year technical carrer I have worked with a lot of websites,
        wrote code in the backend and frontend as well, tried to find the best
        solutions and tried to improve myself code by code.

        My carrer started at evosoft Hungary Kft. (owned by Siemens) as a member
        of a small team. Our main focus was to create websites for engines.
